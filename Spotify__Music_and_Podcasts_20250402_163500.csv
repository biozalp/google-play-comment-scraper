Jeffrey O'Brien,1,"The oee again. Nothing has changed in years. Now I can't even listen to a Playlist, it keeps reverting to a different one! Garbage. Navigating this disaster is the height of frustration. Terrible interface, buggy, everyday settings buried deep inside menus that make no sense. This service doesn't offer anything I can't get elsewhere, and no one else tortures me to use their interface. Uninstalled, again.",2025-03-15 22:24:04,"Hi.

Eden Valencia,5,"This is the best app ever!!!!!!! Stupid Amazon music blocks almost every song so you cant listen to it and if you get premium nothing changes, in fact they TEMPT you to buy EVEN MORE STUFF but spotifys not like that also I'm on a chrome iOS and Spotify works surprisingly well more than other apps do, although I think its only on my computer, I have to uninstall it then download to open it up. I also love a feature where you can block explicit songs so if you have any kids or you are a kid do it!",2025-03-20 18:27:31,
Rheanon Adkins,1,"way more ads than music. playlist constantly closes, and you have to start over. constantly pauses for no reason. tells you 30 minutes ad free, which only crashes the ap or plays more ads. this app only gets worse with time. you can't even use it while driving because it forces you to open up the ap and physically look at the ads. dont waste your time. just go to youtube music if you want a good music app. after 10 years of use, i can happily say im uninstalling this archaic garbage.",2025-03-27 03:23:23,"Hi!

Andrea K,5,"This review is mostly for the customer service. I had one teenie tiny issue going on with my app so I contacted the developer and was absolutely blown away. They were all over it instantly. Going through troubleshooting and everything that could possibly be bugging my app. after a couple days they finally found a fix and my app works flawlessly again. This has always been my go to for podcasts and after this experience, I will not use anything else.",2025-03-28 01:57:02,
Teacup Appleblood,3,"Good interface, but... It'd be way better if Spotify on mobile devices was like Spotify on computers. Just look at how much more freedom you get on a computer when you listen to music in comparison with how limited the mobile version is! I don't know why it is the way it is (most likely marketing, but what isn't nowadays?)... Anyway, not really that good of an experience if you have Spotify Free but I still use it for some reason :/",2025-03-26 18:16:49,
ryan pigeon,2,"Don't fall asleep with Spotify playing. it will start playing random bad podcasts, which will then forever be auto-played, with NO options to remove the unwanted programs from your lists or not play them. FIX THIS! ok app for music and podcasts, but the Adds are ridiculous! I Pay for premium to get away from the adds, but there is still 2 adds every 10 min, only now I can skip them... and you have to have signal to access downloaded songs/files, making it pointless to download them. frustrating",2025-03-21 15:41:04,"Hi.

William Detlefsen,2,"This app has become increasingly clunky and riddled with ads. After listening to a downloaded podcast and deleting it, Spotify keeps it in your queue, cluttering it up and making it harder to find podcasts you haven't listened to. When fast-forwarding past intros and ads, it will randomly put you back at the beginning. If you're looking for a podcast player, I'd recommend going elsewhere.",2025-03-20 13:50:06,
Max Wen,1,"so many years and no updates to the UIX but more and more irrelevant ads. even when it says ""listen to this ad for 30 minutes of uninterrupted music"" it's a complete lie and I'll get another ad after 2 songs. sometimes I open the app and it will have a popular song of the time ready to play even though it doesn't match anything I've ever listened to, they are just trying to boost the play numbers for some artists. impossible to use this app and not see the scam this entire industry is.",2025-03-16 10:10:36,"We're sorry to hear this, and we'll pass your feedback along to the Ads team.

You can also check out other deals by heading over to spotify.com/premium."
Davis Glazebrook,2,"The only thing consistent about Spotify is how frustrating it is. UX And UI change all the time from bad to bad, never gets better. Pay Artists More!! Stop with the limited audiobook credits, paid promotions on premium, and AI garbage like the dj. Let me find new music from artists I follow Instead of burying the releases menu that doesn't even show all of them!! I could write a book about how much I hate this app.",2025-03-12 02:25:46,
Alecia Carle,1,"Just keeps getting WORSE while charging us MORE! Premium service sucks now. You can't add/delete/rearrange songs to the queue anymore. Takes an absolutely insane amount of time for playlists to load now. And it's constantly adding the same songs to the queue... And now there's no way to remove them. Bring back all the premium features and stop taking them away! And the free version is a joke, you use to get 3-4 songs after less than a min of ads, now it's 3-4 min of ads for a song... RIDICULOUS!",2025-03-25 17:24:36,
Pyroshock,1,"When using the Free version of this app, searching and playing a song is broken. For example, if I search and play ""Billie Jean"" by MJ, it will play ""Beat it"" or ""Thriller"". Earlier versions of spotify did not do this and it makes this app one of the most unreliable apps for Free music playing - along with your procured playlists on permenant shuffle. You'd be better off with competitor products. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND - unless you have over 100 dollars a year to blow on premium.",2025-03-09 16:48:02,
Derek DeVries,2,"Subscribed to premium service and I've been nothing but disappointed. The audio quality is good and the catalog is large, but the UI is terrible and Spotify keeps interrupting me with ads/notifications for their other services/features. They prioritize podcasts over music and there's no way to provide feedback on what you're interested in (or not): I had to subscribe to some innocuous shows just to stop them from promoting Joe Rogan every time I opened the app to listen to music.",2025-03-21 21:09:44,
Hellish Champion,1,started ok rapidly turning it's self into garbage. number of ads keeps increasing. I download to listen later so I don't waste data. they have data saving options like do not randomly play something when playback is over. I have that enabled and yet after every downloaded podcasts it starts playing hip hop. I have never listened to music on this app and can't get it to stop. do what every1 else does and use something else.,2025-03-27 20:06:25,
Allen Edwards,3,"good music and interface but the auto switching between devices and the always running in the background of my phone is very annoying. I have disabled the ability to run in the background, force stopped the app and somehow when I am listening on my computer it will randomly switch to my phone. or randomly I will find the Spotify player in the device toolbar open and playing even though I never had the open open. Spotify is auto opening the app in the background without my permission.",2025-03-24 15:30:54,"Hi. Have you tried a quick reinstall?

S Miller,5,"A slight hiccup is happening recently (January 2025... still there March 2025) - every time I open the app and click on any option, it shuts down. I can immediately reopen it and it works fine. But it seems to need to shut down at least once. I believe it's typically when I choose ""Your Library"", ""New Episodes"". Have used app for years and love it.",2025-03-20 13:04:48,
Nemi Santos,1,"I used to loved this app, but now we have a lot of new issues rather than solutions. The new queue system sucks. Can't delete several songs at once. The new ""clear"" buttom only clears songs in the ""queue"" I DONT WANT TO DELETE EVERY SINGLE SONG INDIVIDUALLY! New closed captions on podcast are on the top, it's annoyin When Spotify is open on my PC and I change the volume on my phone, it only changes the volumen on my pc! This app gets worse by the minute and it's seems less worth each time!",2025-03-26 20:38:35,
Tim Miller,1,Tried giving this app another chance. Still a no go. Frustrating that video function doesn't work when connected Bluetooth just because your in a moving vehicle whether your driving or not. This app is so awful and invasive! It will play by itself if you press play/pause on any other player app. TV version is even worse! So many missing functions and trying to simply find a certain Podcaster that that you've even already been listening to is a chore. Avoid at all costs. Not worth the agrivation.,2025-03-17 19:05:43,"Hi. Have you tried a quick reinstall? If that doesn't help, we'd recommend reaching out to our Customer Service at support.spotify.com.

Heather cook,1,"Normally a huge fan. I have over 20000 liked songs, I make a new playlist weekly for work. It has a huge issue scrolling past the first 30 or so songs. Maybe it's time for them to break up the liked songs into two alphabetical groups of you have over a certain amount of saved songs. It's becoming impossible to do the 1 thing I really depend on the app for. Yes, I have already deleted it, cleared out the cache, redownloaded it. No avail.",2025-03-19 00:22:50,"Hi!

Fizz,4,"Still love the app, but I have to say that the UI change to the queue is so intensely frustrating to me. I enjoy that it shows the album covers, but please for the love of all that is holy, separate the things I added to the queue myself from the ""next in playlist"" section again. The way it looks now is super messy to me and really messes with the way I use it.",2025-03-15 07:26:16,
Brynn Sisk,2,"I have premium, and i used to adore this app. however, for the past week or so, the app will just stop playing music after a couple of songs. I have to fully close and restart the app then restart the playlist, and then the process begins all over again. it's infuriating. update, 7/24/24: this still happens sometimes, but now the issue is the removal of songs from my liked playlist. doesnt matter if i liked them years or minutes prior to checking my liked songs, certain ones just wont show up :/",2025-03-24 23:29:00,
Kimberly V,3,"This would be a 5 star app but all of this month I've been experiencing issues, specifically since March 10th, the latest update. I cannot go back to a previous song or restart a song! And this is a problem for me because I am the type of gal to return to a song when I feel like I'm not appreciating it enough. Also, on my PS5, my music will go on an ultimate loop of 1 advertisement until I restart the app. Please let me go back/rewind songs and fix my PS5's Spotify issue!",2025-03-19 21:52:25,
Zaria D,3,"I've been using Spotify for years and I'll admit, it's the best music app you can use. But lately, my reset button hasn't been available and it's causing me trouble. I've tried resetting the playlists, nothing. Closing then reopening the app, nothing. I'm going to see if updating the app will help. Update 1: Still didn't work😓 Update 2: Even tried logging out, didn't work. Update 3: Even redownloaded the app, nothing. Update 4: Spotify, what happened!? Why is the whole app getting worse!?",2025-03-28 06:54:21,
Brian Eyman,2,"I love this app. listen to podcasts every day. until today. it's doing nothing but cache. and causing high battery drain the second I open it. even after clearing cach. please fix devs. of Spotify!!! so i can resume listening.

Nathan Telkamp,2,"Spotify keeps stopping media playback in all other apps whenever it is running in the background (not playing music, just being open). It's super frustrating. I have to force stop spotify any time I want to watch a YouTube video or listen to a Pandora station or anything, because it just repeatedly pauses whatever I'm trying to play. Samsung S22 Ultra. Please fix this. Edit: Yes, I have tried reinstalling. I still have the issue",2025-03-22 06:40:38,"We suggest restarting your device and making sure that Spotify has the necessary permissions to operate in the background.

Chad,1,"Downloaded songs and shuffle ruin the app. I use the app a lot out of service area so I download plenty of music to listen to. When I try to listen to the downloaded music the app only plays rap and hip hop, plays the same 10 songs over and over again out of 2500 plus downloaded songs. It sometimes won't even play other songs I try to select outside the apps chosen favorites, I click on it and it does nothing. It ruins the whole experience of using the app.",2025-03-05 18:08:07,
DeWitt Powers,2,"One step forward, two steps back. The updated queue is nice for swiping songs away, but now it sucks for removing multiple songs at once. It makes it easier to accidentally play the song instead of removing it too. The add to playlist function is broken now after the much needed multi-playlist update. Now if you hit the back button on your phone or in the app, it will clear all your playlists you've added so far and either start you over or close the add to playlist screen altogether. Annoying.",2025-03-05 21:55:06,
Isabella Cila (BavenTheRaven),1,"Unusable without premium. They remove basic features and lock them behind premium for the mobile app. The desktop version is the only usable one, there too many ads otherwise and they keep changing the ui to absolute garbage. Last time I checked they removed the ability to loop just one song if it's in a playlist. Premium isn't even affordable, just a straight up cashgrab from a greedy company. Go use SoundCloud, At least they let you loop songs for free.",2025-03-05 21:18:03,
Ivy,5,"Music is EVERYTHING. It makes me calm, relaxed, and just be in my little small world! I love how I get to do my playlist!! I would use this everywhere I go. In my car, my room, outside, in school, in stores, when I'm bored, when I feel happy/sad, I just love this so much and I'm being so fr! Literally all the songs one needs/knows. The same goes for the podcasts! EVERYTHING is on Spotify with entertaining playlists made by so many people! It is easy and fun to use!! Best app for music/podcasts!!",2025-03-17 05:40:19,
Christina Porter,3,"Used to have a 2 star rating for the app in 2023, and major issues have been updated, but i still continue to have some issues with songs randomly pausing and not playing. The ads are also insane. 3 to 4 30 second ads in a row after only playing a few songs is very irritating to say the least. I don't have the money to be spending $12/mo for premium so it is what it is, but it gets annoying. Otherwise, app is pretty good for listening to music whenever, driving, walking, etc.",2025-02-06 12:02:08,
Julian Eaddy,2,"The app works, but barely. It will throw ads at you every other song, and the ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" is 5-8 minutes at best. On top of that, basic features such as rewinding or skipping a song are lost behind the Premium Paywall (which gets more expensive every 3 months). You can't even pick which song you want to listen to on your playlist, as it's stuck in shuffle mode. It's glitchy. When I opened my phone, music started playing, and it jacked up my volume to max. I'm done. 👎",2025-02-21 20:03:08,
Rachel S.,1,"Suddenly stopped working today. Anytime I go to my library, the app closes. If I even try to play a local file downloaded on my phone, it closes. I've been having a bug for many months where the app would close the first time I went to the ""New Episodes"" podcast playlist, but it was a minor annoyance. This is completely unusable. Frustrating that it happened the day after my monthly Premium charge happened! Hope it will be fixed soon.",2025-02-23 10:47:54,
Miguel.,5,"On my device, it's awesome. I use this everyday, everywhere and always, for over 50,000 minutes. Other than the ads (which aren't too annoying once, again, on my device) it's pretty much perfect. I just don't enjoy how some songs are unavailable because of regions, but it's not a big issue since the mainstream is there as well as a lot of underground. There's not much to complain about, since I use the free version. So far, i say this is great.",2025-01-15 04:57:35,
Spook Spook,1,"It's just ad after ad after another ad. The only pro is that virtually every artist is available, but even then, there are other services with that same variety and fewer ads. Even some features are locked behind a pay wall. I shouldn't have to spend $7+ a month just to turn off shuffle. Plus, their lyrics are broken and are often times faster or slower than the song.",2025-02-18 04:49:52,
Cindie Dowell,2,"Why remove the ability to delete a song from the play queue? I don't understand why I pay for an app that tries to control everything I listen to. Isn't that the whole point of paying? That, plus the fake ""shuffle"" feature makes me hate Spotify. Again, if it's a playlist I made, I like all of the songs! I don't need Spotify to play 5% of them over and over for me and never play the other 95%. I suppose it's time to find a new music service.",2025-03-01 15:56:42,
Lily W,4,"Spotify is a pretty decent music app. It more likely than not has any song you search for, and the design is simple and easy to work with. However, it does have some faults: the ads, and premium. I will get an ad that tells me that the next 30 minutes of listening will be ad free, then two songs later and I get four ads. It's impractical and misleading. There are some perks with Premium, but I should not have to pay to be able to skip songs freely. That's just kinda bogus.",2025-02-22 01:52:26,
Brandy Lutz,1,"Can't look up an artist and see their album to add songs to my playlist. I have to look up each song. I also can't pick a song and listen because Spotify will only play a different song. You already get money from making me listen to ads. I'm on a limited income and can't afford to pay a monthly fee. Also, throwing in random songs on my playlist that I didn't add is not welcome. I want to hear my choices. This makes me not want to use Spotify at all. I'll find a better music app.",2025-02-01 03:54:29,
Jo Batson,5,"I love using Spotify. However, I wish they would bring the option back to rearrange your Playlist via the mobile app, especially when you're paying for Premium Service.

Jamie Cagle,1,"App continuously just keeps pausing my music if I do literally anything else on my phone while using it. I have my playlist downloaded, as I use it for playing music over the speaker at work. I've tried clearing my downloads, restarting my phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app,and nothing fixes it. I try to open up any other app or my browser and it hard stops the music.

Chili waffles,4,"Spotify is great. there’s a huge variety of music. I’ve only come across one thing I couldn’t find (A Groovy Thing, By Flamingosis). I really like making playlists and organizing them into folders. Premium is definitely worth it, no ads, unlimited skips, and downloading playlists. It’s also really easy to connect to a TV or gaming console. Spotify is better than other platforms, especially since the music keeps playing in the background.",2025-01-23 01:38:47,
Annastacia Monroe,1,"Very unhappy with the video constantly playing on the home screen. It's irritating. For the longest time Spotify was the ONE app that didn't have jarring overstimulating videos in your face. Not anymore I guess. It makes me dread opening the app, especially because I used to use Spotify to relax from a hard day. I Just want music. There should be an option to remove the videos from the home screen. It's obvious that Spotify is trying to be the next Tik Tok or social media app.",2025-02-14 21:14:54,
keith saylor,1,"TOOK AWAY THE LAST GOOD THING ABOUT SPOTIFY, the queue!! Used to be able to click queue and select random songs from library in the queue to play next, now you can't, have to individually drag each song to the top. Absolute trash.

Now, it shuffles through my library playlist instead of the searched songs. It's a bummer!",2025-01-11 18:48:32,
Dean Johnson,4,"Have always liked the app. But recently I've been having some issues. I use my ""liked songs"" playlist the most. About 2700 songs.

I just want to be able to view what I listened to for the last 4 songs. ????!

Also idm when it happened but why is it locked behind a pay wall to not have to shuffle the Playlist. Spotify used to be absolutely the best music app and now I find myself tiring of more ads than music.",2025-01-19 15:53:05,
Caeser,1,Can you please fix this app? It's been half a year an shuffle play is still broken. Keeps playing the same 10 songs on a 500 song Playlist. The DJ is a useless feature. Half the time playing the same 10 songs and then random playing Spanish top hits and top ten American hits. It's been over year. I am about to cancel my subscription and find a new app. This is garbage.,2025-01-27 22:52:30,
Melissa,1,I HATE the way the new update makes my queue look on mobile. I have premium and cannot remove songs from my queue or adjust anything with the queue as easy as I used to. On desktop it would make sense but on mobile the updated interface for it is awful and makes me not want to even bother using the app as much as it was one of my favorite features. Not everything needs fixed.,2025-02-25 09:48:28,
James Keplinger,2,"Not good. They don't have an issue taking your money but won't give any support. Actually terrible support.

Vin K,1,"Update: Nothing has changed from my previous review. Additionally they have updated the queue function and it's terribly ugly and less useful than it used to be with the addition of 3 useless buttons at the bottom that hog up the screen.

Price has increased year over year, The audiobook section is pricegated even for subscription holders, and they pay the artists pennies on the dollar.",2025-02-16 00:53:42,

Cam Deguffroy,5,"Spotify is the most amazing app that I have ever downloaded, it has like every single song that exists, and offers most songs in different languages (if u don't speak English). The only thing that I would like them 2 improve is the lyrics and time sinking them. They r most likely 2 fix it if you report it, and when u do it takes like 1-2 weeks to be fixed.

Tanz Afroz,2,"Good selection but needs a better UI like long press to select multiple songs/media. It is such a a pain that you can only move one song at a time in a playlist. When playing from an album or playlist, we need a button to start it over instead of playing from where it was left off. Swipe left to delete. The whole queue should be cleared with one press instead of clearing it twice. I don't know why the Spotify developers don't add these basic features!!",2025-02-21 08:42:15,

That's super annoying and is why I docked a star. But it doesn't happen all the time. After the most recent update (Dec 2024?), it would only play one song and then stop completely.

There is a lot of music to choose from, but many songs from albums aren't accessible if you use the free version. I also can't shuffle the songs on free version. Two problems: music won't continue sometimes after an ad (some are silent, & that's usually when it won't restart)..just goes to pause. 2nd the sound will suddenly stop. I have to close app & reopen to get sound again.",2024-10-22 12:58:38,
Jimmy Melendez (bigjim76),3,"It was all good until you changed the layout on the playlists. I thought the app was acting screwy. I kept closing the app. Somehow, I kept noticing the two words and more on my playlist, and it goes to the songs. What in the blazes did you do to this app? I haven't had this app for a long time, and you're right away charging the app. It was fine the way it is. Please change it back. It was much easier before this hooey of a layout.",2024-12-11 06:53:07,We'd recommend adding it to our 'Ideas Board' over at community.spotify.com. Just head to the Menu > Ideas.

C Boots,1,"Man, I've used Spotify for close to 10 years but it's become such garbage. I have premium and still get ads. While listening to podcasts after a mid-epusode ad break it will sometimes skip to the next episode or many episodes prior. If I get a notification, it will sometimes rewind 5+ minutes. To top it all off shuffling a playlist yesterday played the same song over 5 times withing 30 minutes. Absolutely ridiculous and barely even a functioning app anymore.",2024-12-13 00:15:19,
Danny Martinez,3,"App is good but glitchy. It randomly freezes my music and I usually have to unpause it a few times to get it playing again. Really annoying so I thought my Internet was the problem so I got the individual premium plan to listen ad free and offline, so I downloaded a few playlists turn Spotify to offline and to get no interruptions I turn on airplane mode. It still randomly freezes my songs, I don't understand why no Internet to interfere, good storage, new phone, app updated. I'm not sure why.",2024-12-18 03:18:22,"Hi.

Ken,1,"I enjoy using spotify and have been using it for quite a while. It's definitely been going down in quality - more AI usage that's not very accurate, more bugs and crashes, the same songs playing in order over and over again. Would give more stars if the artists were paid more equitably compared to the owners of spotify...",2024-12-11 18:10:34,
Donovin Harvey,1,"Unless you're going to pay for premium, don't bother. You used to get 30 minutes add free, but no longer. Oh, they still say to enjoy the next 30 minutes add free. After ONE song, you're stuck listening to several ads that run longer than the song you just heard. I thought it might be a bug, but it happens consistently now.",2024-10-31 02:17:02,
pokemon is cool,2,"I still really like the idea of Spotify and how everything works but the fact I have to pay to skip songs after 6 tries and then can't for an entire hour is ridiculous, also not being able to show lyrics is crazy. The Spotify wrapped this year was also weird and ai generated. Can you just show an ad and get 6 more skips??? If you made it where you could watch an ad for like 6 more skips it would be greatly appreciated and you won't lose money.",2024-12-29 08:23:02,
Axmlx,4,"It's definitely one of the best music apps out there the paid version is perfect (obviously) but the free version is just awful. You can't listen to certain songs for whatever reason, and ads go off in literally less than 30 minutes plus having to listen to not one, not two, but about 3-5 ads. And I feel like you should be able to rewind a song paid or not it just feels a little unfair to me.",2024-12-23 06:27:02,

Alexis Huffman,1,"I remember when Spotify was first coming around and getting popular. Over the MANY years I've used Spotify it's just become a money grab to listen to music. I've watched the prices for the subscriptions keep going UP, SO many ads, & it's just gotten so bad over the MANY years I've used it. It's sad cause if there was some other app I would have left Spotify a long time ago, but until that happens I'm stuck with using it until that time comes. U can't even listen to one song without getting a ad",2024-12-28 03:45:04,
Joshua Anderson,5,"As a podcast player, this app is a bit annoying when trying to listen to a queue of episodes. For such a popular player, I can't believe that they have no way to sort them by oldest to newest on Android, only newest to oldest. Update: for some reason the app is shuffling my ""my episodes"" list even though it isn't an option a user can turn on and off. Dec 2024 update: they've resolved the queue issue and the podcast listening experience is much improved. Now 5 stars.",2024-12-16 23:08:33,
Mark Baldassari,3,"I've been using Spotify since day 1. And I've edited my review for it countless times as things have changed for better and worse over the years. My current review is as follows: This is still my favorite all around music streaming app. Best user interface by a landslide. That and the music library gets it 5 stars all day. But what is KILLING ME is the long awaited release of their ""lossless"" version. The lack of sound quality is what pushed me to favoring YouTube Music in my car. WIN ME BACK!!!",2025-01-06 23:39:15,
Aiden “River Carver” Smith,1,"I used to use spotify alot and I thought it was the best music app, but that was only because I was paying for premium, without premium you can't even skip or pick any of the music, you can only use shuffle or play it the playlist regularly but with my playlist I have a bunch of the same people over and over and that gets annoying, plus the app usually closes when I try to use it in the background then it gives me three 30 second ads after it just told me I get 30 minutes of uninterrupted music.",2024-11-30 05:14:39,
Courtney Clendenning,2,"I enjoy the variety of music provided, but I wish DJ would actually allow me to explore new genres and artists rather than just play my liked list.

Francisco,5,"Best song streaming app in my opinion. I like the way it's all layed out. You can pretty much find any song there. Only downside this app has is that if you are using the free version you are limited to 6 skips per hour you can't choose the shuffle style, and the most annoying is the Ads. I payed for the premium version which is much better.",2025-01-06 04:21:26,

Also, thanks for expanding more into video podcasts and including audio books. I look forward to the day when Spotify beats youtube. Keep up the great work! One gripe: stop the location tracking with the duo plan. As long as you get paid, you shouldn't care how users share the app. Be grateful that users want to pay you to share this app with others.",2024-12-07 05:46:19,
Paul Parker,3,"Good music, poor storage management. I like the playlists and many of the suggestions after picking favorite artists and songs. The AI DJ is just plain weird, playing music I wouldn't choose. My biggest gripe is with the download storage.

Anyways I'm still pretty new 2 the jam feature, but I've quickly noticed, at least when im on a jam started by not me, I cant go and find those songs in my recents list afterwards, which is a total bummer. I can see some songs, but only ones I've already liked, which kinda defeats the purpose IMO, since usually I'm there trying 2 find songs I wanted 2 save but couldnt.

Toby,2,Glad that they seem to have fixed the algorithm but really pissed that the queue is different now. Like one of the the main reasons I used premium was so that I could use the queue to preemptively skip songs without having to interrupt my listening session and now you can't do that for some reason?? I just don't get it,2025-01-27 00:34:32,

Matthew Sechrist,1,"There are so many good things about Spotify, but the performance of this app is not one of them. Many songs simply stop playing, forcing me to dig out my phone, open the app, and start it over. It's like it just forgets what it was doing. If it happens during the ""enjoy 30 min of uninterrupted music"" after watching an ad, it forgets and the very next thing after the song that gets restarted is an add.

My hands are shaky, so swiping to remove a song from the queue often ends up with me playing it on accident. Bring back easy-to-press buttons!

Jace Stouffer,1,"You know, I'd be fine with ads, but just not playing any songs I want to hear is a super bad look. I click on a song, it plays a completly different song, which I still have to watch ads for. Why?? If I want to listen to random songs with ads still, I'll just go to YouTube. Even Youtube will play the correct song and also give me a nice video. I'm not paying you loads of money I can't afford just to actually hear a song that I wanted to see if I liked.

Amy Lynn,5,"Amazing app! Small errors, but I love how it keeps playing in the background if you have that option functioning.

If you don’t pay you get the most bare bones app ever. I don't mind having my playlist on shuffle. I prefer it actually. But I can't even pick the song I want to listen to in my Playlist because apparently wanting to listen to a specific song on your Playlist isn't allowed and you need to pay to do that.

Little Rookie,4,"I use the app all the time, even had Premium for a while, but noticed the ad system is terrible.

The only reason I keep it is because my teenager prefers it. I'm ready to ditch the family premium plan and switch to something else for my own use so I can get this intrusive app off my device. I Love the wide array of music though!",2025-03-18 16:03:40,
Kayleb Downing,2,"pretty good for listening to music and calming down, except for the fact that when I try to listen to a playlist, instead of an artist itself, it always adds random songs into the playlist, from completely different artists because it thinks I would like that song. I'm trying to listen to one artist, not 17 random artists they think I would like. pls fix this, I use this all the time to keep me calm but if that keeps happening it's not going to help me stay calm.",2025-03-20 06:35:23,
Andy Harmon,5,"A few weeks into having ad free music and I am loving it. The short repeating videos are a bit weird but the way that the lyrics are laid out are very nice.

But I digress, myself and the wifey are enjoying the music. Rock on.",2025-03-13 04:50:26,
David Teal,2,"""Recommended songs"" constantly interrupting and completely taking over my listening experience and consistently ruining it, even worse when paired with limited song skips...I wouldn't have to skip if it just played what I selected; no option to turn off this annoying ""feature"" to make it worse. If this is to push for buying Premium, this is an awful and obnoxious move, mobile version is far too annoying.

Jaime Sanchez,2,"I like that I can hear the music I enjoy but the system is pretty bad rightnow in terms of the queue. I can select any song from my Playlist and it will just be put in the exact same queue everytime instead of making a new one. Not a single song changes but the one I selected. Also when I scroll thro my liked list, it takes so long to load if you scroll to far. I don't have any internet issues so I don't see why it would be doing that.",2025-03-20 06:54:58,
Ven,4,edit: finally got around to reviewing again. it's a lot easier to find things on here than YT music (imo) and I like that it gives 30 minutes of ad free every now and then. *** prev: I got to open lyrics on one song two times and it wants me to pay. why should we have to pay for something that not all the songs even have???,2025-03-30 22:45:40,
Halo Jac,5,"I love Spotify, but... Recently, it just seems buggy. Most of the songs don't play when they're supposed to. It's just kinda broken... But that's okay 😌 And a feature that I loved, was when you'd search up songs and albums and it would just loop those songs, but I think it got removed? I don't really know. But, I still love the app. It still a great music app 😁 Edit: THEY FIXED IT YAYYY! <3",2025-03-20 06:38:21,

I've also noticed the majority of the time the app is glitchy. Last couple days I can't even play specific songs from my liked list, I'm forced to start the shuffle on whatever Spotify picks 1st.

Markus Gentry,3,"Usually a good experience using the app as a single premium user, but as of late while streaming songs, they will abruptly stop in odd spots. No internet issues on my end, as this has occurred in multiple wifi locations and cellular. The stop will be about a half second and won't occur more than once a song. This is bothersome especially for an app that im paying to use.",2025-03-14 17:37:32,"Hi. Have you tried a quick reinstall?

NellzForBells,2,"Honestly this app sucks, it's almost impossible to use without premium. I shouldn't have to pay to pick what songs I want, you only get like 6 skips an hour witch is horrible if it keeps playing songs your not in the mood for. Also the ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" is a lie. I get like one 3 minute song and I get and add Also normally around every 3 songs there 3-4 adds. Also limited lyrics?? Like yall just seem extremely money hungry. People shouldn't have to pay for a decent app.",2025-03-10 04:40:00,

I don't like Spotify.",2025-03-20 06:49:13,
Yayan,4,App works well now. Can listen to all my fave songs both on the go and at home. I currently dont mind the number of ads but when an ad does appear it forces you to go back to the Spotify app on Chromebook which is annoying and it would be great if it was like the mobile version in the fact that it doesnt force you into the app whenever an ad appears.,2025-03-16 20:40:53,We're glad to hear that.

Eja Mathis,3,the app is excellent for listening to music but at the same time it sucks. If I go to play a song I search it plays a different one. If I am listening to music in my liked once it's done with all the songs it plays random songs. If I want to change a song in my liked it plays a little preview and won't let me actually listen to it. when I am listening on pc however it is perfect none of that happens. the mobile version just needs to be more like the pc version,2025-03-18 09:51:53,
Samaire Atkins,4,The app itself ain't too bad. Had premium for awhile but recently the categories on my liked songs don't seem to work right. Every time I play a genre from the category it just plays all the songs from my liked playlist. It's frustrating too because I cleared the cache and redownloaded the app and nothing seems to work. I've had no problems till now.,2025-03-23 04:36:16,
Brandon White,2,"For the price of premium, you could just buy an album or several individual songs each month, and you'd own that music. If you lose premium, guess who's back to square one? Honestly, one of the worst ""free"" music experience options out there. Always on shuffle, an add every couple minutes, and when you search a song spotify doesn't even play *that* song, they just put the songs artist on shuffle. Is it decent without premium? Bad without premium, and even with premium there's better options.",2025-03-15 01:34:48,

The Discover Weekly was once my favorite playlist and gave me amazing music to listen to. Now, it only gives me stale and overly similar sounding music. Daily mixes never stray from the same few songs every day. This platform is no longer fun to listen to and does little to learn my tastes and expose me to new things.",2025-03-26 03:12:19,"Hi!

Nikole C.,2,Ads have gotten worse on the Home screen with paid subscription. It's obvious there's AI instead of people building algorithms now. I miss the old spotify. Please provide a way to turn OFF smart shuffle. It's not that smart.

Olyvia B,3,"30 minutes more like 30 seconds.

Citrine The Corgi,3,"So the main perk of having spotify premium is that you can listen to music offline, and while that is kind of true, its a little bit deceptive since if you're listening to a playlist offline it for some reason will still try and play songs you dont have downloaded and it spends all day trying to loading so you have to skip until it finds a song you already have downloaded which is inconvenient. id say just bear with the ads and get the free version.",2025-03-24 03:32:25,"Hi!

Jaylynn,1,"The free version of this app gets worse and worse with every single update, and with the constant barrage of ads it's basically unusable. I wish it stayed like it was back in ~2018, when you could actually choose what to listen to and get more than two songs per every seven ads. Get it together, spotify.",2025-03-11 07:48:55,
Avery Kalyn,1,"Every time this app updates, which I am occasionally forced to do to continue full-featured use, I am met with a bug where the app refuses to use wifi and will only connect via mobile data. When I search for solutions, I am reminded that this bug has been an issue since 2015. A full decade is an inexcusable amount of time for a company this substantial to leave such a substantial bug unfixed, even more so one that affects a paying customer's ability to use the app.",2025-03-21 18:03:45,
Riddy89,2,"Nice to have music in a central place, but there are too many issues. Random isn't random for Spotify, and will play the same selection over.

Will,1,"The reason I will never get a subscription again is because it's obvious what kind of ethics Spotify has. They deliberately make Spotify unusable to those who don't subscribe in an attempt to get them to subscribe. I just wanted to listen to a single artist, and Spotify cut me off after around 20 songs. Figured I'd try again even tho, I knew what might happen. Sure enough, the exact same songs, in the same order. No other service does this. Just don't even offer a free version at all, Spotify",2025-03-27 14:11:03,
Korbin Dallas,1,"Update: App stopped working. Update didn't fix it. Content is amazing but navigating the app is difficult. Please include an option to disable ""swipe next"" feature.

I have more issues and I have emailed Spotify but with limited success.",2025-03-22 21:11:19,
Jerome Sliter,2,Originally the ads were tolerable. Spaced far enough apart. Now its 3 ads after 2 or 3 songs. And its the same 3 ads. Left slacker radio (XLive) for the same reason. *edit* been paying for Spotify to avoid the ads. I have 2500 liked songs. and it still only plays the same 100 if I put it on shuffle. going to keep the 2 star rating.,2025-03-31 12:53:02,
Jordan “gordo” Zanatta,2,"Increasingly janky. Increasingly glitchy. Increasingly more interested in being Tiktok than having a usable interface.

Liked songs filter hasn't worked in at least a week, but hey at least the bar is purple now. Can we stop endlessly iterating on the interface at some point?

Tim Kelly,5,"Thanks for fixing the problem with the like button not appearing for songs not currently playing. Recently I've noticed the genre selection from within my liked playlist isn't accurate. For example I can choose metalcore and there are many tracks that aren't close such as daft punk. For the chill genre there are tracks that include some of the heaviest music in my liked. love this feature, please look into this. Thank you!",2025-03-25 16:23:26,
Caitlyn Powers,1,"4 30-15 second adds in a row is way too many especially after I watched the add to get 30 minutes of add free music but instead of giving it to me it just played more adds. This issue has been going on for months now, I'm tired of it. Other than that everything is great, easy to navigate and use. - August 2021 I just went back to the free version and it's unusable unless you already have completed playlists 👍 - March 2025",2025-03-27 02:54:00,
Dakota Davis,1,"An app that makes itself significantly worse so you'll pay for it, soon I'm sure they will remove the feature to even play in the background for free users. 30 minutes without ads hasn't worked in ages, even if you go in and watch the ad in the app (a horrible feature btw) after you get confirmation on 30 minutes free you WILL get an ad after your the next song. things will stop working on this app and they don't care.

I'm on the latest version of Spotify (Premium) and it doesnt let me play the playlist in the order, also when I switch off the shuffle it come back on in 10 seconds.

Ink Jet,2,"listening to music - great! However I hate the fact that spotify are pushing their own ads inbetween podcasts. As I've already paid premium, you're now making me pay again. And no, this isn't ads included in the creators podcast, they are played separately before and after the podcast. No point paying for premium if you mostly listen to podcasts, purely because Spotify feel like they haven't made enough money out of you.

Mystic Claw,5,"I rate it 5 but it's more like 4.5... love the app, listen 24/7, spotify gives great audio and having atmos is also really good! I love that I can download music and listen whenever. Premium is kind of expensive imo but worth it. my only gripes are that it doesn't have every single song, I can't expect it to; There are a lot of original songs that I have to listen to covers of :/... beyond that, and this may be user error. I'd like to sort by any genre, but it offers random genres at the top.",2025-03-20 18:42:42,
Carter Peska,1,i am very unhappy with spotify. you used to be able to choose your own songs on a free account. and that was the best part on spotify. but now you have to have premium to pick your song and that infuriates me. i dont know if i would even want to use spotify again if they bring it back to free accounts because of how mnay times they have taken things from the free version,2025-03-16 10:30:09,We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us.

Stephanie H,1,"Using this app without premium isnt usable For mobile.. This app locks normal features behind a pay wall. I shouldn't have to pay to play songs that are I LIKE, Shuffle mode ruins the whole experience, it keeps on playing random songs that isn't in my Playlist. I don't doubt there's better apps than this one. This would've been at least a four star if again, the shuffle mode wasn't behind a paywall, the adds are okay- i get 1-2 adds every 3-4 songs.only problem is shuffle, fix it.",2025-03-24 01:43:22,

Marna Howard,1,just another bland app .Latest update has ridiculous Bluetooth feature so whenever I'm in a hotel I can take over another rooms playlist and they take over mine I have to listen to the podcast in the order they were released newest to oldest as opposed to oldest to newest. And now their newest problem is that the playlists I create stop after one or two songs. User interface is now terrible. This app is bloated and has become just another X Instagram social media platform. Just stick to music.,2025-03-22 07:45:41,
Ghost Guy,5,It does what I want it too. But you know what would make it super cool?

Justin Zimmer,2,App is meh. So many ads in free that it's almost not worth listening to. They push misinformation in the form of podcasts.

Charles Riewoldt,1,it's so frustrating to add a song to your playlist then they just want to add more songs to it forcing you to listen to songs you don't even like or ain't relevant to your playlist and every time you try to play your playlist it takes you to a completely different playlist or if you decide you want to listen to a certain artist it takes you to a different one it forces you to listen to that.

Sometimes it gives you the ""Here, after this ad, you can listen to music for 30 minutes straight now!"" plays a song then two more ads.

ALSO: tap the three dots next to any song. Then select ""go to song radio"" and you get a whole new playlist to explore. The PC app version is a lot more involved, but worth the learning curve.

Grace Rucker,2,"I have had this app for a loooonnng time. I have had it on 2 tablets and a phone. It used to be awesome, I could choose whatever song I felt like hearing and see the lyrics or skip if I wanted to. But now, NONE OF THAT HAPPENS. The playlists no longer have each song in a list that you can click on. You have to play the playlist on shuffle. You can only look at lyrics or skip like 4 times and then you have to get premium, which I am not doing. I will be deleting the app, go back to what it was.",2025-03-03 18:05:01,

When I click on an artist, I don't want to only listen to their 10 most popular songs. Give me a list of all their music and not just divide it up by album. 2. Even though I use it, the DJ option is honestly annoying as all it wants does us stuck to a small pool of songs.

No place holder, or reason, just poof gone. I can't even finish a single book without them ruining it. At this point, it's best just to get rid of it",2025-03-04 02:37:53,

Jay Jaxxter,1,NEW UPDATE 3/6/25. Zero stars if I could. On a premium family plan. It's mid. My biggest issue with the app is it stopping and restarting a song I'm listening to when I'm trying to text on snap or even browse through apps.

The negatives: With the free version, I've had multiple times when supposedly after watching an ad I get 30 minutes uninterrupted listening, only to get an ad after the next song.

Sarah Hilton,5,"I love Spotify and all the music choices,and the audio books .Premium is great that passes the ads,and gives the opportunity to listen to audio books.

Aliya,2,"I usually use this app to listen to something as I am doing something, but this year had been unbelievable. Ads (especially about premium), no skips and not allowed to pick which song you'd like to listen from your playlist. I think this is crazy since I don't see people paying for a membership if they just want to hear a tune once in awhile. Sometimes, the app will cut off your current song and switch to another. I also hate it when it switches to a whole different music type?!",2025-01-24 02:33:53,
Lulu Lemon,3,"Premium is *ridiculously* expensive for what it is! £11.99 a month. For £1 more, you can get a monthly Netflix subscription on two devices at once.

It's so easy to use and I love how it makes up play lists according to the genre of music you like.... 'Your Top Songs 2024' is totally spot on with 6 hours of all my favourite songs put into a play list! The only issue I would have is when you search for a song, they keep repeating it unless you change it. Other than that, download and pay for the premium as it is so worth it!!",2025-01-29 20:47:47,

Tracy Hodgson,1,"This app is only good if you're paying for it unfortunately. I keep getting adds which to a degree is fair enough on a free plan. My complaint is that I open the app, the add starts & there's a message saying there'll be 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening. This is never the case as there's approximately 4 long sets of adds within approx 20 mins or every 2 songs depending on the day. This definitely isn't 30 minutes of add free music.

Gunnar Ricard,3,"Why does shuffle replay literally every single song of the last 4 hours of itself when I have 20+ hours of music on my liked songs?? Frustrating to skip through 100 songs straight to get back to random. Please fix. The ""previous song"" button should take you to the last song you actually listened to. If you ""add to queue"", play that song, then afterwards press ""previous song"", it will be like you never played the queued song. Very silly & unhelpful design in my opinion.

Indeed, it has so many ads you would just wanna listen to a looped song on Youtube (it doesn't put ads in-between, for now).

Goostav,4,"Been using it for a couple years, it's great but I've noticed a couple annoying things. Firstly, it has recently started randomly turning on shuffle. The UI is extremely cluttered. Also the differences in UI between mobile and pc seem unnecissary to me, such as not being able to see streams on songs, not being able to see how many songs I have in my playlist on mobile and having the length of albums at the top on pc but at the bottom on mobile).

•Alice•,3,"Overall, Spotify IS good. But recently, it's been changing. The desperate amount of ads and features that have been blocked for non-premium users is frustrating. You're only allowed to skip 6 songs per hour, are forced to listen to your playlist on shuffle, and now, the lyrics have been also blocked...

Mike F,1,"Like most apps now, it's set up to be as user unfriendly as possible to people not wanting to pay for a premium account. Search for a song and press play and the app will proceed to play two to three completely unrelated songs to try and get you to use up your ""free"" skips. So your choices are skip multiple songs just to get to the one you wanted or listen to six minutes of random music to get to the one song you were looking for. Embarrassing",2024-12-22 01:17:39,
Sarah Duke,1,"Was generally satisfied with the paid service before latest update, EXCEPT for the fact that as a company you are blatantly exploiting artists. And since the update before last to the app, skipping or resigning to previous track is extremely unpredictable if pressed more than once - will skip 5 songs instead of 2 for example. It also now plays the first few seconds of a song, then goes silent (but still shows it is playing). WiFi is working, it's definitely the app.",2024-12-18 14:39:22,

The whole point of getting a premium account initially was to get rid of the commercials. There was a time when the podcasts would only have commercials if the creators embedded them. Now podcasts are filled with commercials regardless of whether the original podcast had them or not. It's out of control.,2024-11-14 21:32:15,"HI! Podcasts usually include some advertising. This has been the case since the early days of podcasts, and continues to be true today, including on Spotify. Therefore, even as a Premium user, you may receive advertising or sponsored messages when playing a podcast. Note that as a Premium user, you still enjoy an ad-free music listening experience."
A Google user,1,"Stop putting ads in my app as a premium user! I've been paying for premium for about 10 years now, but I am increasingly getting ""sponsored recommendations"" which is a fancy way of saying Spotify is deciding to advertise their own content to me or taking money from someone to advertise their content to me. When I open the app 1/3 of my home screen is some dumb band or podcast or audiobook that I can't get rid of & doesn't match my taste profile or how I want to use the service I'm PAYING for.",2025-01-08 14:53:24,
Naj Garcia,4,"I admit that i made a fault of not paying my subscription on time this time. But if only my downloaded songs have been retained after i paid my premium account. My country has slow internet connection and not all of us has the convenience for fast internet, sometimes there are even outages and some areas are deadspots (the latter is inconvenient when traveling). So re-downloading those songs in playlist is really a hassle.",2024-10-30 16:58:29,"Hi there! We're sorry to hear that.

Tonya Gr,4,Pretty good app. Play lists & expansive music library. Offline playlists are great Only grips : - for duo/ family accounts you have to enter your shared address EXACTLY (eg rd not road) as the original family - they don't post small pay artists fairly / proportionally for streams. - You can't seem exclude a search word from results - sometimes Spotify playlists/radio songs aren't in keeping with the suggested artists / genre,2024-11-10 06:38:10,
Andrew Robinson,4,"They moved it around so the suggested music is less intrusive back to 4 stars. Now if they could auto equalise volume of music, have the explicit on or off as a toggle button at the top of play lists instead of hidden in settings and random selection be better to not select a song until all others have been selected then I would give 5 stars",2024-11-15 16:50:44,
Kimberley Sooka,2,"I've had this app for quite a long time and i loved it but now everytime i finish listening to a song, it doesn't play another song I always freezes.

Brian Hermon,2,"Spotify what's the problem recently with skipping tracks? I listen to a playlist, press ""next song"" and it just plays a random song rather than the next in the playlist. My playback is NOT on random and it does this on desktop and in the android app. It's super annoying. What's the fix???",2024-10-20 20:00:09,"Hello, Brian!

Sean Williams,4,The Spotify library is always expanding. It has a broad collection. Even a good amount of obscure music I like. It does have trouble staying on top of newer releases. There are still a good bit of tracks that can only be found on YouTube or SoundCloud but I'm impressed with Spotify's overall growth,2025-01-01 17:17:51,
Lauren Anderson,3,"Updated review: Still like the app just fine, but MAN do I hate the comments feature on podcasts. It was one thing when it was just asking for feedback, but opening up comments is making Spotify devolve into the same vile, cruel cesspool that social media is. PLEASE go back and get rid of this. There's enough nastiness out there already. I know people who have ditched Spotify because of its turn toward being more like social media, and I get why.",2025-01-04 05:45:39,"Hey!

Elizabeth Blake,1,"NOT WORTH IT. Whatever you do, don't get premium. The second you go back to regular, ads are quadrupled. Without premium, the ads are still bad. Every once in awhile, you'll get an option ""wAtCh tHiS aD aNd yOuLl gEt 30 mInUtEs aD-fReE"". It's an outright lie lol. They'll play 1 minute of music and give you 4 more ads back to back. And even if you make a playlist of 4k songs, no matter what, it'll ALWAYS play your top 40 most listened, and you'll never hear those other 3,960 songs EVER AGAIN.",2024-11-10 00:18:22,"Hi! Thanks for your feedback. To make sure you're getting the full 30-minute ad-free period, there are a couple things to keep in mind. First, you'll need to keep the video ad in focus and avoid navigating to another app or browser. Also, be careful not to accidentally click the ""No, thanks"" button when the ad prompt comes up."
Disa Battaglia,2,"This app has so many bugs. Will restart a podcast episode half way through, won't load anything despite having playlists downloaded for offline uses. It also will frequently kick me out of the app. Mid episode on a podcast and it just stops and closes itself. It is so irritating I am debating not paying for this anymore.",2024-11-09 15:18:31,"Hi.

Hannah Bowling,1,shuffling doesn't even work. when i play music in shuffle in my car and switch to my headphones it starts repeating the same songs that were played in the car in the same order. happens the same when i listen to music with my headphones and then play music in my car. it still plays songs that have been removed from playlists and liked songs when smart shuffle is off. this app is broken and they just keep raising their prices,2024-12-11 23:14:47,
Ifan Jones,1,"Can't play songs outside of playlists, can't play playlists in order, they have made it so you cant listen to songs in the likes section, they have adds every other song, this app has become cancerous to use, the desktop version is perfect but this ain't it.

Matt St.Cyr,2,Where's the new music! I miss going into my old discover playlist or even my daily playlist and at least find a few new songs to listen too. It's mostly songs I've already listened to and very out of place songs on my daily playlists that doesn't fit the vibe. I've been on this app for a really long time and it's just really disappointing.,2024-11-11 22:03:21,"Hi, Matt! Appreciate the feedback. You can always add more tracks to your playlists to replace the ones we recommend. For more info, head to support.spotify.com > search for Create playlists > Suggested songs."
Oepe,2,"Two stars at best, there's like an ad for every song you pick, then another one after two or one songs. It's like I'm listening to ads at this point. Don't even get me started on the song selection, you can pick a song only 5 times a day and when you skip the 5 chances I get to pick the song gets used too along with the 6-7 skip chances that reset every hour, just make us able to pick any song three times per hour or something. Reduce the ads too, it's unbearable listening to it on free.",2025-03-04 10:35:25,
Sara Rupp,5,"I love all the different playlists on here,, they let me explore different genres and often I find music I haven't listened to in years!

Eli Kirshenbaum,2,"I swear i used to be able to search on the watch app, tho maybe it was only on the old Tizen Samsung watches. But if it worked there I see no reason not to have search on WearOS too. I should NOT have had to pull up the YouTube website on my watch to choose a song when I left my phone at home. Other than this it's a great app, I love the layout and it works well for the limited function, but search is such a dealbreaker that it can bring an otherwise 5-star review down to only 2.",2024-11-26 16:06:06,
Sri Vaishnavi Adivi,4,"The app and it's designs and features are amazing and incredible sound quality. I love it overall, but too many ads and pressure to take premium and the choice of selecting our songs to hear or skip to next song etc...these basic features are removed if the premium features are used for anything other than these basic features it will be good and feasible to all the app users other than that there's no problem with the app. It's amazing as it is",2024-12-04 04:07:45,
Clare Hooper,2,"It has had such potential for so long... But falls short on so many things! This review box doesn't have enough characters & I am over trying to convey this to someone important who wants to listen (tried beta vs, tried online suggestions, etc). Was switching to SoundCloud then the audiobooks were added! Still think more audiobook hours should be available on premium - 15hrs = 1.25 books/month & unfair some podcasts added to audiobook category & therefore included in this 15hr allowance.",2024-10-19 10:21:49,
Vladislav Stamboliev,5,"A very large audio library providing good automated daily risk and recommendations. I have tested it in hip hop and it is the same as tidal, but it is better in podcasts is those are not existing in tidal, and apart from hip hop probably it's a bit better as title started with hip hop. However this case podcasts and maybe more with regards to other music genres. Spotify is a very good music App!",2024-12-25 02:28:45,
Phil McGladdery,5,"The best audio app by far provided you're willing to pay the monthly subscription. The free version is a pain in the posterior, but then there's no such thing as a free lunch and ive never failed to find what I'm looking for on Spotify.

Nato,1,"Editing my review to give all the problems i have: 1. Half the songs can't simply be clicked and played instantly, i have to queue them up so they play 2. My recommendations are non-sensical, providing me with songs from a variety of languages that i dont even know a single word of 3. UI is becoming worse overtime 4. A flood of AI music has started to flood the app I have discovered.",2025-03-03 16:11:20,
Farheen Feroz,1,"Well this used to be the best music player but after the new updates it's the worst, I mean it's literally telling you to buy premium or else you can't do anything at all, even basic features like playing the previous song, playing a particular part of a song, repeating a song and turning off smart shuffle requires premium. It was a really good app but now it's just trash. I hope they bring back the old features back or else this app's going down. I can already see the reviews going down.",2025-02-15 03:23:16,
Trisha Bokhandi,1,"terrible. i wish i could give this 0 stars, you have to pay for almost everything, just to skip songs you don't feel like listening to you have to wait an hour after skipping 6 songs. also features like playing a playlist in order aren't available to me for some reason? seems like something that shouldn't need to be paid for, this streaming service is only for the people with enough money to afford a monthly paid service.if you're short with money this is a TERRIBLE option. would not recommend.",2025-03-03 21:20:38,
Cecco,1,"Personally i prefer Youtube for listening music. The cost is too high for a too short range of songs. Youtube has many songs that in this app it's absent and for free. To be able to listen songs that you'd like to listen... (cuz it plays random songs + you're gonna listen to ads) ...you must pay. Excluding this, the app is great, works fine and i like really much how it recommends songs that you'd like",2025-03-04 11:02:42,
Mimi Keu,2,"I'm a free user, and personally, I don't mind the ads. They have good quality music, it's easy to use, and you get to find new music and artists... although lately I've been struggling to get anything new, they keep recommending me the same songs over and over again. The queue hardly changes, and the shuffle button doesn't really work.. Hope they get that fixed though, a few years ago, it was really great with adding relative songs to a queue.",2024-11-08 23:47:38,
George Lourens,4,"It's really good, probably not the best or cheapest out there, but it is easy to use. I just really really wish there were more customisation options to customise the UI to different colours, shapes, icons, whatever else. If they could just add that, this would hands down be the best streaming platform, not because of sound quality (where my HiFi, Spotify?), but just giving users what they want. Personally, i haven't used other platforms much, but it's better than Youtube music",2024-10-20 16:48:22,
Chronical Varsity,3,"Your UI needs an overhaul. So cluttered, same with desktop. And fundamentally the radio function is pretty useless once you've listened to it twice.

Tasha McNee,3,"Overall I'm happy but the issue of autoplay for podcast. If you listen to one it then goes to your autoplay list & there's no way to get it off. While driving, an episode of a podcast I like & follow finishes then starts an episode of a podcast that I may have listened to once but did not like. I've combed through the settings & there's + ways to like/add a podcast to your list but none to remove it from your autoplay. Fix it!!",2024-10-16 03:34:49,
Richard Rafter,1,"Great app, but I am cancelling. It is starting to get too expensive. My family account just jumped from $16.99 to $20.99. At the rate they are increasing their prices, We should be getting another $5-$10 increase by next year. At the current price, it is cheaper to just buy physical copies of music. This is similar to when they increased CDs to $27-$30 per album and we all started downloading music for free because it wasn't worth it to pay for it anymore.",2024-10-03 17:47:32,
schlauhonk,4,"I have always loved spotify, but I must say the most recent update just ruined the home screen. There used to be tons of suggested playlists, ""made for you"", etc. The only thing that remains are the six most recently listened to playlists. The rest has been replaced by autoplaying snippets of random songs or playlists that i have literally no interest in, and there is no way to turn this off. Please give us the old home screen back, i am absolutely disgusted by this update.",2024-11-14 00:28:32,
Ashvita Siva Prakash,3,"Look, the app is awesome and I actually recommend you download it. But in recent times there is 3-2 30s un-skippable ad after 1-2 songs. Spotify says that it provides ""30 min of no ads"" but that's just not true! I don't know why they make claims which they don't follow. Over all there are wayy to many ads for this app. The app itself is good and provides alot of abilities",2025-03-26 14:19:45,
Stacey Micallef,3,"It's fine, until you finish a pod & it starts playing a random pod that you've never listened to or don't like. There is no way to remove certain podcasts from playing, pls add a not interested button for podcasts! Also paying for premium & only getting 15hrs of audiobook play is a laugh. Barely 1 book in most cases, barely 1 week of listening to/from work on my commute, then oh no, have to wait another 3 weeks to finish it. Forget listening while you work. The time top up is a rip off.",2025-02-26 07:42:35,We'd recommend adding it to our 'Ideas Board' over at community.spotify.com. Just head to the Menu > Ideas. Others will then be able to vote or add to the conversation to show their support.
Tony Montana,5,"Amazing app on all aspects. Huge collection of data, songs and artists of various styles of music and in different languages. Originality and richness of playlists based on your favorite artists and taste of music, sound quality and many many other good options. I actually tried different apps like Anghami and that was a very bad experience, believe me Spotify is far better in every way, even what you get with the free version is enjoyable and might be sufficient for many.",2025-03-14 09:48:06,
Bernard Boakye,4,"The application has been performing exceptionally well in delivering its services. It possesses an outstanding and user-friendly interface, making it the most convenient music streaming platform I've ever used. The algorithm has shown significant improvement and is now functioning better than before. However, there are a few features that I genuinely wish were included, such as Dolby Atmos and Lossless Audio. Additionally, Spotify please get rid of the smart shuffle, it really upsets me, A LOT!!",2024-09-20 19:00:10,"Hi! Thanks for your feedback. Since Spotify works with an algorithm, you can recalibrate this by listening to your Liked Songs and playlists as much as possible.

I haven't even mentioned how laggy it is the how it always crashes/freezes yet. unusable scam of an app, only reason I haven't switched is due to the amount of songs I've saved",2024-12-06 21:12:15,
Relebohile,1,"Edit: from worse to the worst. Songs I've had hidden for years are appearing in my queue. It's almost pointless using this app. The updates get worse and worse, adding features that give nothing to the user experience. I do not want DJ. I do not want smart shuffle. These features go completely against having a premium account where I can customise my experience.

Sure, but I can see that recently it's putting more recommended songs before some of the songs. And I only get 6 skips max an hour. Annoying if I just wanna listen to that song.

Dylixia,1,For the last few months I haven't been able to play liked songs for a majority of the time. I can play them by searching for them or playing from a specific playlist but not being able to listen to the liked songs playlist is very frustrating and defeats the whole purpose of the app. Occasionally it will work for a few days then stop again.

Soundcloud is genuinely better. Do not recommend this app.",2024-11-15 02:14:23,
Codey_tee 07,1,I don't know how such a bug is even possible. I've reported this issue in app more than 10 times. The lyrics somehow don't show. When I press on share lyrics it shows me nothing but a background. Now the mind boggling part is that when I tap on that blank background it seems the lyrics are being selected but there's still nothing on the screen and then when i finally hit send the lyrics pop up. Beyond me honestly I'm going to YouTube premium,2024-09-13 13:04:25,

I have a playlist with 1000+ songs, and yet I hear the same few songs more frequently than others, which is frustrating. I do not want to use third-party apps/websites to do a simple randomizer of my playlist as that should already be function in the app itself.",2025-03-17 23:07:50,
Dan A,2,Randomly skips ahead when listening to a podcast or just randomly fast forwards to another podcast on my list. Extremely frustrating and happens way too often. Lacks basic sorting functionality. Eg. I dont think it's too much to ask to see a list of all the artists in my library.

Lena BZ,1,This app is just too complicated to navigate! I have Spotify on two separate devices but the only difference is the way to navigate through the app and it's really confusing. Another thing is the amount of skips. Why should you have to pay for premium to skip a song? You can only skip a song six times before you're suddenly required to pay for it! Also when I'm trying to play a separate song it just continues to play the track I'm already listening to.,2025-03-28 14:54:03,
Rosie Clark,3,"I've used Spotify for years now, granted its now quite expensive but that's not my issue. My issue is for the past month or so I can hardly ever search or new songs, add them to playlists or play half my songs - I've tried it on mobile data and different wifis so it isn't that. It needs fixing, there seems to be a lot of bugs going on with the app at the moment.",2025-03-26 14:40:18,
Catherine Needs,3,"This was a much better app but has recently worsened with its use of AI generated playlists and people paying for their music to be recommended - im now finding it hard to find new music from smaller artists, which is a shame. The premium prices have also increased most years, which is a must for even using the app. I'm also not a fan of how little money the artist actually receives from a stream. Otherwise it's function is good and it has a large library to look from.",2025-03-11 11:42:40,
Darshan Biradar,1,"I love Spotify and also have been a loyal customer for years now, but with this new update, where everytime I tap on the anywhere near or on any button in the control section, it shifts from up to down and goes on for every touch, every time I change the time of a podcast, the control section goes up and down.

Shaun Mamidi,3,"This app is overall good for music, but the biggest problem is that some features are locked behind premium, and we have to pay just so we can switch between shuffle and play in order, loop playlist/song. Another huge thing is the ads, please make these ads every 5 songs insteas of 2/3, having to listen to an unskippable 30 second ad every 2 songs is hell. It would be great to fix those problems and not be so money hungry. But overall this app is good but can be annoying sometimes.",2025-03-21 15:12:02,
Rachel Devito,3,"I would give this 5 stars because I love the app, its easy to use, and I can make fun playlists but there are a lot of annoying ads after every second song, I have to reinstall the app every time I open it because it doesn't load, and it glitches when I try to play it in the background while I'm in another tab.

Even worse, the app repeatedly fails to recognize passwords after they've been changed! You go through the tedious reset process, use the app once, and then face the same password rejection when you return.

I'd say that if you have the money you should consider the premium because the free version is decent despite that there is a lot of ads, 6 skip per hour and that you can't choose directly the music you search for ( gotta listen to some songs by the author before ).

Very astonishing audio quality, the app works better than before, love the tiny new features, But need huge improvements on the shuffle, cuz I've been seeing so many times where the app would play the same songs I've listened to with very unlikely getting to listen to a new songs here and there, Either make a system to play different ganres but keep it close to what I've been listening, to keep adding new songs to the mix, or make the system better at suggesting",2025-03-28 10:55:36,
Chrisovao Arruda,2,so I've used this app for years mostly for music. I pay for it only to watch the price rise and the technical difficulties rise with it. the simple Syncing to devices will cause the apps enchanted shuffle function to switch to default or force close itself. I've overlooked this for 2 years. the biggest kick in the pants is the audiobooks. I have found a love for audiobooks only to find out there is a limit to how much I'm allowed to enjoy like my years of payment isn't enough.,2025-03-29 18:23:42,
Prasan Naik,3,"Overall experience has been good, but there is some issue with the offline caching and downloaded songs.

Valeria Elisei,1,"the app is completely unmanageable if you do not have premium. You have 6 skips per hour, you cannot listen to the song you want to listen to at the moment without a completely different song playing before, the ads are unsufferable and overall it feels as if I'm listening to what the app wants me to, not what I need it to play. Nowhere near a 5 star rating.",2025-03-22 23:35:28,

Edoardo Bianchi,1,"I'd give more features for whoever wants to stay on free-plan. I'm ok with the ads and all of that stuff, but you can't give 5 skip per hour and it might not even give you the song you were wishing for.

Evelyn Ho,4,"good streaming app, ads aren't too bad either but one thing is that I wish they would let you play your playlist over and over on mobile. on mobile if you finish listening to all the songs on a playlist,it starts playing smart shuffle(songs not in your playlist) and there's no way to play your playlist again(at least not that I've found). you have to wait for a few hours for it to play the playlist songs again which can get kinda annoying esp since most of my playlists are quite short",2025-03-22 09:56:05,

Skimming audio by repeatedly tapping bar e.g. skipping a min ahead, few seconds behind, mini/maximises the playing track so you have to alternate the height of where you're tapping, on every tap. This is a pain when trying to navigate to a particular part of a podcast. I'd have thought an app so big would have ample QAs to notice the impact of removing features people use multiple times every day. Also too many adverts.",2025-03-19 03:06:03,"Hi.

Loreley Lory,3,"Honestly, I've been using Spotify for a while. In the beginning, it was perfect - it gives the possibility to make your own playlists and listen to whatever you want (randomly if you don't pay). But lately it's not working anymore.

dave rascall,2,"It all works very well, plenty of choice etc. But the quality is too low for me. The dynamics and clarity of the music are just not as could be. The compression is audible (for those who have experienced the difference) Not worth it as other services have the same choice and work just as well but have a way better quality. MP3 quality is so 90's. With modern day bandwidth on broadband/WiFi we can have proper bandwidth on music. Like having a 8K TV and playing VHS on it, doesn't make sense.",2025-03-29 02:15:22,

Only bad thing about it is that unlike on a PC, spotify on mobile requires premium to choose whatever music you want to listen too and you cant change the order of which the music plays as in random or in order of the songs. but yeah apart from that its all good.",2025-03-16 11:27:56,
Sérgio Pereira,3,"I have used this app for quite a long time now. But then the last update really turned me off, as always.

Guess wha happened? It's no longer available! 🤬",2025-03-09 20:28:19,
Brahim HABIBI,3,"too many ads! a minute each 20min!! thats too much. not being able to skip music is ok, understandable, but dont u know, getting premium for free is always an option and will always be the option for many users. i can get it for free and i am gonna do so. i installed the original app to support the devs, hoping you changed so many nuisances in the app but u did not. untill then, Spotify premium is available for free on a lots of secure websites. i hope u reconsider, some things....",2025-03-25 18:59:14,
Kamo,1,"spotify treats free users like garbage. we can't even listen to our ads because we are constantly being interrupted by the music (if you get what I mean). it seems like if you don't have premium, it's extremely difficult to listen to music because you are constantly bombarded with ads, disgusting ""smart shuffle"" that plays the most irrelevant songs that don't even correlate to your actual music taste and a skip limit of 6 songs per day??? now I am expiriencing double ads aswell. annoying as heck",2025-03-24 04:59:17,

KIRO (Maisie!!),3,"App is fine I guess. I've noticed that on tv and ipad (eg), there are barely any, if no, ad breaks. Mobile increases it by ALOT, which is annoying. I've been using grayjay as an opposition because the amount of ads makes listening to music, especially whilst im asleep, virtually impossible. it's just annoying. if you can minimise it for tv and ipad, why not your primary downloaders- mobile users??",2025-03-21 23:06:16,

Khushal Bafna,1,"I’ve been using Spotify for years, but the recent restrictions on free users have made the experience frustrating.

Kotocel,1,"Too Many Restrictions on Free Version. I just wanted to listen to one specific song, but instead, the app started playing a whole playlist with other songs. After skipping six times, I got a message saying I needed to buy Premium for more skips. That’s really frustrating! Why can’t I just listen to what I want? It feels like I have no control over my own music unless I pay. I understand paying to remove ads, but paying just to pick songs or skip more? That’s unfair.

But now, Spotify has decided to lock this basic feature behind a paywall. Seriously? Looping a song is not some premium luxury—it’s a fundamental music feature! This just feels like another way to push people into paying for Premium. Instead of improving the free experience, Spotify keeps taking away features that were once available. Cash grabbing app",2025-03-28 18:00:48,
Kitty,3,"It's good, you can listen to a lot and It's nice that you can listen to music with friends but that feature is not as good as it could be. For example when we do not listen on the same speaker, the person who joins will have a lagging song and sometimes their songs in the queue will be skipped. The app in general freezes sometimes and uh yeah. Not bad but should do better.",2025-03-14 08:22:15,
Amira Arissa,2,"Too many premium, I can't even enjoy it. What happened in the updated version? Oh nothing, just the ability to fast forward and rewinding got taken away. Only skipping is available. No option to put the choosen song on repeat as a phone user. This app could be great if this problems never occur. Just hope there's no more premium in the future, cause I ain't spending my money for this. It's as if you guys are desperately trying to get us to buy premium. But I know the developers tried their best.",2025-03-08 05:52:15,

Bethie “Moonflower” Boo,3,"As an Autie, Spotify was a great place to listen to music, with creating playlists for whichever mood I'm in (let's just say that there's a whole lot of repeated songs in a specific order..). Well, it Was the best app, until an update changed everything, and the choice to make a playlist the way I not only want to, but also need to (again: Autie..), are gone. Unfortunately, the Queue isn't a good replacement, considering the need to redo it every time. Please, let us have that option again!",2025-03-07 23:42:36,

Optimistic Person,3,"Spotify is great, but it has quirks. If downloads over cellular are disabled, it won’t download new songs, which is fine. However, frequently played songs are cached locally to save data. If I want to officially download a cached song, Spotify won’t allow it without Wi-Fi, even though no extra data is needed. It should simply move the cached file to the downloads folder instead of enforcing the Wi-Fi restriction, making offline music management more efficient.",2025-03-08 07:39:06,"Hi.

Amit Sharma,2,"Spotify is a good app no doubt. But there is one big number which is its premium. There are many restrictions after sometime like: we can't play songs of our choice, can't play a specific part of the song. We only get 6 skips per hour. Sometimes it becomes so irritating.

Ashim Khaling,1,"Spotify is an overpriced, glitchy mess. The free tier is unbearable, with constant ads and forced shuffle. Premium keeps getting pricier with no real improvements—still no HiFi!

Examples: • after each app restart, the speed resets to 1x • it's not possible any more to queue podcast episodes, • it's not possible any more to see which episode will be played next, • after a while, they start playing random episodes in non-chronological order, including also already completed ones. Big delusion. Google Podcast was perfect, Spotify is way worse and keeps getting worse.",2025-03-06 20:05:44,
Kamie Davies,1,"Right now I literally cannot use the app, it won't load any liked songs and it won't let me play any songs the app does let me see. What's even worse is that is that I reinstalled the app and now it refuses to let me log back in??? It told me that something went wrong so I assumed it was just bad college WiFi, so I tried again when I got home and no change. I cannot go through getting all 1000+ of my liked songs back, plus all my playlists and podcasts.",2025-03-05 22:06:54,"We'd recommend restarting your device to see if that makes any difference.

Dulusmita,1,"Please, Spotify developers !! Make all the issues clear like we can't play songs depending on our choice the premium comes. And also we can't forward or backward parts of song. This is not right. Spotify is a good platform but please make all these issues clear. We can't even remove the song ,it needs premium. Also lyrics doesn't come in most of the songs. It gives much and more problems. Nd only 6 skips? What the hell is wrong with you guys? Can't we used it without getting any disappointment??",2025-03-03 11:30:20,
B Targ,1,"A music app should not be this laggy and slow. Hanging my entire device for several seconds (including playback!) whenever I unlock my phone to move around my queue is just unacceptable. Unfortunately Spotify lite doesn't have a reorderable queue like the regular app and it doesn't read my existing downloaded song data from the regular app, so it isn't quite a good enough replacement (not to mention I had to sideload it because of arbitrary regional restrictions!)

loraksiukas,3,"It's a good app, but I have a question. Why do they add songs to your playlist you don't even know exist/you don't want to listen to? That's a problem that I have experienced many times.. I hate the fact that they also play suggested songs without even asking if you would want to. And the fact that you can't listen to songs on repeat just made it worse. Also, why only 6 skips per hour and not per 30 minutes instead?

Naima Njenga,3,I really like the app it's something I use almost every day but there's some things I would change in the free version of the app starting with letting people skip the song without any trouble on mobile but on laptop / pc / computer I can skip as much as I would like to. One more thing I'd like to add is that when i search up a song and then press the play button it doesn't give me that specific song and i end up having to skip all the others.,2025-03-04 11:57:29,

mikael que,5,"If you're the kind of person tat has a ton of music saved on yoyr library, Spotify is the most storage friendly app out there, but of course, it'll come with the cost of having a lower sound quality. I've been subscribed to Spotify premium since 2016, and I haven't had any major issues with the app since then",2025-03-28 12:08:30,
Avinash Rajak,1,"Too many ads, can't play a specific part of the song, can't play previous songs(the option has been disabled for non premium users), can't shuffle play the playlist, can't listen songs on loop, can't see lyrics for most songs(everything has been shifted to premium). Does anyone has a better alternative for this. And now this new problem I've encountered is that I can't add a song multiple times to a playlist. PLEASE fix this issue Spotify developers",2025-03-02 20:58:00,
Apollo Benedict C. De Luna,2,"It's not bad overall, I had this app before 2019, but now it's just bad. Before, everything needed was free. Downloading music offline, playing songs in order, and no ads. Those were all free until 1 bold decision was made. Now everything just needs premium, Aka, money. So it kinda feels like a money-steal now. When everything was free, then.",2025-03-16 17:46:36,
Perk “ShadowNinja”,3,"Spotify it good because it is the only app that I can listen to music while playing on my ps. but I hate when I get the same flipping ads or i get blasted by an ad that ruins my music flow like I can listen to calming music, and then an ad about rock music will show up. that why Spotify is a 3 star for me",2025-03-23 13:36:25,"We're sorry to hear this, and we'll pass your feedback along to the Ads team.

Mandy Scullion,1,"I love this app, it's the most used on my phone. However, that last update has caused playback issues ... after a while when app is locked playback stops and when the app is closed it stops. I've tried all troubleshooting but nothing is working. please fix ASAP!!!",2025-03-25 03:49:18,
Shiv,4,"I really like Spotify for its music recommendations, especially since I tend to stick to older songs. It's been great discovering new music this way. However, I feel the UI has become a bit too cluttered compared to the minimalist design it had before. One other thing that frustrates me is the swipe function—the music screen keeps pulling down into the small bar, and it seems like you need a very slow, precise swipe for it to change and not minimize. other than that its my go to app for music",2025-03-24 18:20:42,
Madhulika B,1,"Might as well just make it a completely paid app, the free version is annoying and really tests your patience. With the new updates, you can't play the song you want, it's pointless if a music app doesn't play the song you want. I think the premium version is great, though. The free version, on the other hand, is literal trash.",2025-03-06 18:55:11,"Hey there. Rest assured that your feedback's passed on to the Ads team.

S o n e t t e /ᐠ。ꞈ。ᐟ\,5,"In general, Spotify is fantastic. The quality of the music is great, the app is easy to use and the variety of artists fabulous. I would give it a 5-star rating if the app didn't crash so often or on my laptop it says ""can't play this song"", which is super annoying. Also the daily mixes changes throughout the day. When I think I'm listening to a certain set of songs, they change before I get those songs😢.",2025-01-25 14:37:35,
Zahnel,1,"Why do you need to lock the most basic features behind premium?? You literally can't even play your playlist after listening to a few songs, they start playing random music not related to your playlist, and the Spotify wrapped(2024) is just ai generated slop and doesn't give a ""personal feeling"" that it used to give(not to mention that the ai is really inaccurate. And they FIRED REAL PEOPLE FOR AI SLOP.) This is only the tip of the iceberg. FYI this is a company that earns BILLIONS every year.",2025-03-15 18:48:33,
Diego Vieira,2,"I use this app daily. That's what I think about it at the moment: There are a lot of bugs related to tracking the listening time for each podcast episode (like some episodes are marked as finished just after starting), and the 'add account' button is placed in an inconvenient location.",2025-03-13 02:41:31,
adrian rainbow,4,"Love this app, use it every day and have been for many years. I don't like the new update with the queue system, even if I set the playlist to repeat, it doesn't show the next song in the queue when it reaches the last song before it starts over. The feature to queue multiple songs at once is also gone, you have to do it one by one. The same goes for removing songs from the queue. It's also annoying that ads play before and after a podcast episode, even though I have Premium.",2025-02-27 10:02:46,
Varinder Singh,3,"I'm not sure what the Spotify team is currently working on, but there is still no light mode available. Additionally, there is no option to disable irrelevant suggestions or remove unnecessary items from the home screen. Implementing these changes would help simplify and declutter the interface. Many times, I've considered switching to Apple Music or YouTube Music, but due to the ease of use of this app while driving, I hesitate to make the switch. Otherwise, I wouldn't think twice about it.",2025-01-15 19:27:34,"Hey, thanks for the feedback. We're always aiming to improve, so we'll be sure to let the right team know about this.

Arseni Lazarevich,1,"I don't know why and what happened, but the app is horrible now. It is slower than it used to be, freezing all the time, bugging. The most annoying thing is when you are in the middle of your song list and minimise an app even for a sec and then open it again, you are thrown at the beginning of the list. You can't scroll down immediately, app will freeze,showing you, maybe, first 50 songs, you have to open/close it several times before it works again. I am glad I am switching to YouTube music.",2025-01-22 00:59:49,"Hi. Have you tried a quick reinstall?

John Ellis,1,"I use it, but feel stuck with it more than anything as I subscribe to the family option, so changing isn't easy. The audio options don't compare to rival services, it's now several years since higher quality audio was revealed as ""coming soon"", but still nothing. The home page is just a mess. And why do I continually get asked if I want to join a jam with others, sometimes total strangers on public transport!!

While using driving and having two app running, Spotify just stopped. Now I've uninstalled the app hoping this issue will stop, now I can't even login. Every time I've tried, an error message pops up advising me to try again. I don't want to cancel or stop using this app but it looks like 2025 is the year for me to part way with Spotify.",2025-01-09 16:59:53,"Hi, we're sorry to hear this.

Samuel Lucas,3,"The playback experience is surreal. It's really good. However, I have one strong criticism. Once, a podcast was selected by mistake because it appeared in the suggestions and I accidentally clicked on it. Now, it won't disappear from the suggestions at all. And I don't want it to keep appearing. I did some research and saw that it's not possible to delete it. They recommend uninstalling and reinstalling the app. But that's a lot of work... A simple button to delete that suggestion would solve it",2025-02-02 20:14:49,
Jay Lawrence,3,"Coming from using Spotify mostly on a computer, the experience on the app leaves much to be desired. The forced ""smart"" shuffle is awful, and not that ""smart"". Occasionally you get a notice saying you can listen to the next 30 mins ad-free. Usually that lasts for 1 song before more ads that are poorly recorded, repetitive, and often in a different language. I don't mind listening to advertising as the price of entertainment, but there need to be some kind of standards. Disappointing app.",2025-01-27 03:54:59,
Karl ODonoghue,4,"Generally a good app. Easy to use and navigate around. 2 things I'd like to see change. Remove auto play for video(those stupid looping vids). Just a distraction l. Maybe an option to have on/off. Also, for your auto generated playlists/daily mix, can you include more than the same 4 songs from each artist. Gets boring. Otherwise, a good experience. Oh. How about go back/forward 10/15 seconds for songs, like you have for podcasts.",2025-01-18 15:12:33,
Sam Sung,3,"Okay. I love Spotify but, the updates sorta trash. 1. Non premium users can only skip through songs 6 times each hour. Like why? What if you need to skip, or you wanna choose a different song? 2. You can't view your songs anymore. I mean, you still can but, it's just words. So therefore, you can't change/choose songs. In short, the update is more a downgrade :/ If you changed it back, then that'd be awesome!",2025-03-02 11:23:12,
Skylar Smith,2,"I used Spotify for years and never had a real issue with it, however they started showing up VERY fast. The algorithm stopped trying to show me new music, at all. Even in my Discovery Weekly playlist it was filled with artists I knew. It's become the most expensive music streaming app, without the best audio quality (at least in Canada). It's become so swarmed with AI ""features"" that it's getting hard to use it normally, I don't know who told you people like AI slop but we DON'T!",2025-02-19 14:57:17,
A Google user,1,"I'm extremely frustrated with the Spotify app. Despite being updated, I've experienced a persistent issue over the past two weeks. Every time I exit and reopen the app, I'm met with a blank black screen - no UI, nothing. Repeated attempts to reopen yield no results, and the app only seems to work again after a day or so. This glitch is infuriating and needs to be fixed ASAP. I tried reinstalling too, it works for a day and then back to showing blank screen.",2025-01-15 09:47:46,"Thanks for trying it.

inky bitz,4,"I'm using the free service and wanted to see if it was worth paying to join. I'm disappointed by the fact that although I chose a certain song to play it plays a completely different track! I was pressing on the correct track, but it played another by the same artist. This has happened many times when I chose a single track or even an album. Update - Following advice from Spotify it seems to have sorted out the problem, thanks. Dunno why I didn't think of that!!",2025-01-10 17:55:56,"Hi! Have you tried a quick reinstall? If that doesn't help, we'd recommend reaching out to our Customer Service at http://support.spotify.com.

Daniel Chilufya,5,"I've been using Spotify for over a year now, and I can't recommend it enough! Here are a few reasons why I’ve given it a five-star rating: 1. **Vast Music Library:** Spotify offers an extensive library of songs, albums, and playlists across all genres. Whether you're into pop, rock, classical, or indie, you'll find something to suit your taste. 2. **User-Friendly Interface:** The app is incredibly easy to navigate.

Mark G,1,"I've used this for many years both free and premium. Now I have premium and for the past month or so music stops randomly. Nothing I do fixes it either (ie. Clear cache, restart phone/app, unistal/reinstall, and every other suggestion out there). Not sure if there has been an update recently that is causing this. I have yet to find the cause. I will update this review back to 5 stars once it starts working again...that is, IF, it starts working again. I hope so, it's usually really good.",2025-01-28 23:43:04,
Keketso Nkwe,4,"I love the daily mix's curated by genre and feel, which I can choose from to match my mood. My music taste is quite eclectic, and this feature of spotify makes it the best music app out there. Songs radio feature is a win and the large library of podcasts.I would like the interface to be a bit cleaner. Sometimes, it feels a bit too cluttered. Also, it doesn't continue the same list of suggested songs when transferring from one device to another. This could be an area of improvement.",2025-01-29 22:24:43,
navreet sharda,3,"My experience has yet to change with Spotify. I like using the blend with my friends, however it does not show songs we have in common anymore- just a symbol of our profile next to 1 song. We have no clue except the blend story. The ad buttons are unbearable, I have yet to use premium,however, I noticed that the thumbs down button for Spotify doesn't help at all. I've heard something over and over again, and I dislike it each time. Please fix this.",2025-03-01 00:16:28,
Paul Williams,2,"Been a premium member for over 10 years and whilst I can't fault the music selection, recently the algorithms or something are letting it down. ""Tailored"" playlists just play all the same artists, shuffle just plays the same songs in the same order. I get recommendations from artists I've tried to hide while missing new content from the ones I follow. The reliance on algorithms actually makes it harder to find new music, not easier. I'm tempted to change music service after all this time now...",2025-01-23 11:21:54,
Esther Ayumu,2,"I downloaded Spotify and absolutely loved it. I didn't use premium just because I am not old enough to pay but I was fine with the regular way Until a few days ago, I noticed that I can't move and song forward or back and also if it is in a playlist, I can't replay a song before moving to the next one I don't know whether it has to do with my phone or not. If it something that those without premium experience then it's notfun at all It makes the app really stressful to use. I wanted another app.",2025-01-16 01:05:35,"Hey there!

Twistedpug 007,3,"The service is amazing and whatever. My one painstaking grievance is their awful offline mode. App is almost unusable at times when in offline mode. When I have no WiFi or data signal, playlists won't load, app barely launches, songs don't play, can't see the queue, can't change shuffle mode. So many issues. Reopening the app barely ever fixes these issues either. Not sure why this is such a big thing.",2025-01-10 02:57:11,
Mariana Ancelani Ribeiro,4,"Terrible new update. The queue is now unusable and impossible to delete tracks from it, you need to do a very slow and poorly designed swipe action (the old selecting a dot was very intuitive and easy to use). Makes listening to playlists very difficult if you want to have some control of what is playing next. The visual is also not the best. Still a good app, but now seems more concerned with passive listening than letting you have some choice.",2025-01-14 22:42:53,
Alessia Bathgate,3,"I like this app, it's not very laggy or anything. However, I don't like the fact that if you don't have premium you can only use smart shuffle when I wanna use the normal one. My playlist always plays a random song that isn't on my playlist. Also you can only pick a certain song like... once a day. Sometimes it feels like my playlist shuffles through the same few songs each day and it's kinda annoying. other than that it's good.",2025-02-15 03:27:49,
Andrés Robles,4,"I like this app as I use it pretty much everyday on different devices. However, since a recent update, the lyrics of all songs are not visible anymore, but this is happening just on my Samsung S7FE. This problem is not happening in my phone (also Samsung).

Paul,2,"The media notification on my phone regularly loses track of the song's progress when I am casting to any speaker (either via Google Cast or Spotify Connect). The song still plays but this is an annoyance. I have to re-open the app to fix things, but then it's only a matter of time before it goes wrong again. Deleting and reinstalling hasn't helped.

JustARandomPearson lol,5,"Edit: I had an issue, but it was fixed. Btw, it's a really good app to use as a substitute for YouTube since you can go do something else without keeping your screen on or staying on the same app, although the algorithm isn't as good and there are a lot of ads.

Sarah,3,"There is should be a large, obvious warning that you will lose downloads if you need to reinstall. I'm having problems with a feature, and HAD to reinstall as one of the potential fixes (didn't work anyway), and I lost my DLs which is *very* annoying. Also I just don't really like the new queue.

Shayla,2,"I used to love Spotify, it was a great app. But now it's absolutely terrible if you don't have premium. You can't shuffle or play a playlist in order anymore, it will use a different option which will add songs based on the playlist. And you can't rewind or repeat songs, not to mention the constant ads. I decided to switch to a different app because of the new updates, since I can't stand this app anymore and I am unable to get premium. I would love to at least get shuffle back for non premium.",2025-01-20 05:21:39,
Ain Sofea,5,"""While Spotify is a great app, there are some areas for improvement. The shuffle feature could be more random, as it sometimes repeats the same songs.
