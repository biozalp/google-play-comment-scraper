Jeffrey O'Brien,1,"The oee again. Nothing has changed in years. Now I can't even listen to a Playlist, it keeps reverting to a different one! Garbage. Navigating this disaster is the height of frustration. Terrible interface, buggy, everyday settings buried deep inside menus that make no sense. This service doesn't offer anything I can't get elsewhere, and no one else tortures me to use their interface. Uninstalled, again.",2025-03-15 22:24:04,"Hi.

Eden Valencia,5,"This is the best app ever!!!!!!! Stupid Amazon music blocks almost every song so you cant listen to it and if you get premium nothing changes, in fact they TEMPT you to buy EVEN MORE STUFF but spotifys not like that also I'm on a chrome iOS and Spotify works surprisingly well more than other apps do, although I think its only on my computer, I have to uninstall it then download to open it up. I also love a feature where you can block explicit songs so if you have any kids or you are a kid do it!",2025-03-20 18:27:31,
Rheanon Adkins,1,"way more ads than music. playlist constantly closes, and you have to start over. constantly pauses for no reason. tells you 30 minutes ad free, which only crashes the ap or plays more ads. this app only gets worse with time. you can't even use it while driving because it forces you to open up the ap and physically look at the ads. dont waste your time. just go to youtube music if you want a good music app. after 10 years of use, i can happily say im uninstalling this archaic garbage.",2025-03-27 03:23:23,"Hi!

Andrea K,5,"This review is mostly for the customer service. I had one teenie tiny issue going on with my app so I contacted the developer and was absolutely blown away. They were all over it instantly. Going through troubleshooting and everything that could possibly be bugging my app. after a couple days they finally found a fix and my app works flawlessly again. This has always been my go to for podcasts and after this experience, I will not use anything else.",2025-03-28 01:57:02,
Teacup Appleblood,3,"Good interface, but... It'd be way better if Spotify on mobile devices was like Spotify on computers. Just look at how much more freedom you get on a computer when you listen to music in comparison with how limited the mobile version is! I don't know why it is the way it is (most likely marketing, but what isn't nowadays?)... Anyway, not really that good of an experience if you have Spotify Free but I still use it for some reason :/",2025-03-26 18:16:49,
ryan pigeon,2,"Don't fall asleep with Spotify playing. it will start playing random bad podcasts, which will then forever be auto-played, with NO options to remove the unwanted programs from your lists or not play them. FIX THIS! ok app for music and podcasts, but the Adds are ridiculous! I Pay for premium to get away from the adds, but there is still 2 adds every 10 min, only now I can skip them... and you have to have signal to access downloaded songs/files, making it pointless to download them. frustrating",2025-03-21 15:41:04,"Hi.

William Detlefsen,2,"This app has become increasingly clunky and riddled with ads. After listening to a downloaded podcast and deleting it, Spotify keeps it in your queue, cluttering it up and making it harder to find podcasts you haven't listened to. When fast-forwarding past intros and ads, it will randomly put you back at the beginning. If you're looking for a podcast player, I'd recommend going elsewhere.",2025-03-20 13:50:06,
Max Wen,1,"so many years and no updates to the UIX but more and more irrelevant ads. even when it says ""listen to this ad for 30 minutes of uninterrupted music"" it's a complete lie and I'll get another ad after 2 songs. sometimes I open the app and it will have a popular song of the time ready to play even though it doesn't match anything I've ever listened to, they are just trying to boost the play numbers for some artists. impossible to use this app and not see the scam this entire industry is.",2025-03-16 10:10:36,"We're sorry to hear this, and we'll pass your feedback along to the Ads team. For an ad-free experience, we'd recommend checking out our Premium plans. If you've never had Premium before, you should be eligible for our trial. You can also check out other deals by heading over to spotify.com/premium."
Davis Glazebrook,2,"The only thing consistent about Spotify is how frustrating it is. UX And UI change all the time from bad to bad, never gets better. Pay Artists More!! Stop with the limited audiobook credits, paid promotions on premium, and AI garbage like the dj. Let me find new music from artists I follow Instead of burying the releases menu that doesn't even show all of them!! I could write a book about how much I hate this app.",2025-03-12 02:25:46,
Alecia Carle,1,"Just keeps getting WORSE while charging us MORE! Premium service sucks now. You can't add/delete/rearrange songs to the queue anymore. Takes an absolutely insane amount of time for playlists to load now. And it's constantly adding the same songs to the queue... And now there's no way to remove them. Bring back all the premium features and stop taking them away! And the free version is a joke, you use to get 3-4 songs after less than a min of ads, now it's 3-4 min of ads for a song... RIDICULOUS!",2025-03-25 17:24:36,
